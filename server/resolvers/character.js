       * Search - Pop from unused maze tile and DFS coordinates
       * Vortex - Make sure both are vortex
       * Escalator - Make sure both are escalator on same mazeTile
       * Move - (up, down, left, right)
       *
       * Also here we need to check if all characters are on top of items
       * which will prob happen when the character moves on to an item
       * we will then check the rest to see if they are on an item too
       *
       * Something similar will happen when they are running exits
       *
       * Basically a lot of helper functions will need to be here
